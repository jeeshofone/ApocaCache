## Recent Updates

2025-02-02: Fixed content state update and file matching logic in content manager. All integration tests now passing successfully.
Key improvements:
- Fixed file matching logic to properly handle exact matches
- Improved content state updates during the update process
- Enhanced logging for content list parsing
- Verified concurrent download functionality
- Confirmed atomic updates working correctly

Next focus areas:
- Optimize download performance
- Enhance monitoring capabilities
- Improve error handling and recovery
- Add more example configurations for different use cases

2023-10-27: Updated library-maintainer configuration to always pull ZIM files from https://download.kiwix.org/zim/; removed dependency on local kiwix-serve URL.

2025-02-02: Updated docker-compose.test.yaml and run_tests.sh to test the production library-maintainer container built from the library-maintainer folder. 
Next steps:
- Investigate why integration tests are not being discovered (collected 0 items) in /app/tests/integration.
  * Verify that test files have correct naming conventions (e.g., test_*.py) and that __init__.py exists in tests/integration.
- Fix any test discovery issues.
- Continue to commit and push changes frequently as part of continuous integration.

# First Run Experience Improvements
- [x] Created a default library file in `examples/kiwix/library.xml` with a default Wikipedia zim entry.
- [x] Updated `README.md` with a 'First Run Setup' section detailing how the project works out-of-the-box.
