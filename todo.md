## Recent Updates

2025-02-06: Implemented comprehensive MD5 verification system
Key improvements:
- Added MD5 verification for existing files
- Enhanced logging for verification process
- Improved download integrity checks
- Added detailed verification status to logs
- Integrated MD5 checks into download decision logic

2025-02-02: Updated Kiwix server port configuration to use port 3119 instead of 8080 to avoid conflicts with other services.
Key changes:
- Modified docker-compose-english-all.yaml to use port 3119
- Updated documentation to reflect new port
- Verified service accessibility on new port

2025-02-02: Fixed content state update and file matching logic in content manager. All integration tests now passing successfully.
Key improvements:
- Fixed file matching logic to properly handle exact matches
- Improved content state updates during the update process
- Enhanced logging for content list parsing
- Verified concurrent download functionality
- Confirmed atomic updates working correctly

Next focus areas:
- Optimize download performance
- Enhance monitoring capabilities
- Improve error handling and recovery
- Add more example configurations for different use cases

2023-10-27: Updated library-maintainer configuration to always pull ZIM files from https://download.kiwix.org/zim/; removed dependency on local kiwix-serve URL.

2025-02-02: Updated docker-compose.test.yaml and run_tests.sh to test the production library-maintainer container built from the library-maintainer folder. 
Next steps:
- Investigate why integration tests are not being discovered (collected 0 items) in /app/tests/integration.
  * Verify that test files have correct naming conventions (e.g., test_*.py) and that __init__.py exists in tests/integration.
- Fix any test discovery issues.
- Continue to commit and push changes frequently as part of continuous integration.

# First Run Experience Improvements
- [x] Created a default library file in `examples/kiwix/library.xml` with a default Wikipedia zim entry.
- [x] Updated `README.md` with a 'First Run Setup' section detailing how the project works out-of-the-box. Fri Feb  7 00:33:39 AEDT 2025
## Issues Identified
- Stack Exchange content download failing due to MD5 verification issues
- Mirror sites not properly providing MD5 files
- Need to implement better error handling for MD5 verification

## Next Steps
1. Modify content_manager.py to handle missing MD5 files more gracefully
2. Add fallback verification methods
3. Implement better mirror selection logic
Fri Feb  7 00:37:52 AEDT 2025
## Progress Update
- MD5 verification improvements successfully implemented and tested
- Downloads now continue even with missing MD5 files
- System properly uses meta4 file MD5 hashes

## Next Steps
1. Monitor system for any potential issues with skipped MD5 verification
2. Consider implementing additional integrity checks for non-verified downloads
3. Add metrics for tracking verification success/skip rates
Fri Feb  7 00:39:19 AEDT 2025
## Code Update
- Removed .md5 file fallback verification
- Now exclusively using meta4 file MD5 hashes
- Simplified verification process

## Next Steps
1. Monitor system performance with meta4-only verification
2. Consider implementing additional integrity checks for non-meta4 downloads
3. Update documentation to reflect meta4-only verification
Fri Feb  7 00:42:40 AEDT 2025
## Bug Fix
- Fixed MD5 verification logic to properly use meta4 hashes
- Moved MD5 hash extraction outside the mirror loop
- Added success logging for MD5 verification

## Next Steps
1. Test MD5 verification with various meta4 files
2. Monitor verification success rates
3. Consider adding retry logic for meta4 file fetching
